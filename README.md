# Data Professionals Survey Power-BI-Project
In this project, I use data collected from 630 data professionals from various countries in the world to discover meaningful insights. 
I cleaned and sorted this data by ensuring there were no duplicates, split columns by delimiters in order to increase accrucacy of results and used DAX to create calculated columns. 
I then used different visualization tools to visualize the data on a dahboard to show the patterns discovered within the data.
It was discovered that the average age of the data professionals surveyed was about 29 yrs with majority of them being from the United States. Majority of the survey takers indicated that it was neither difficult nor easy to break into the Data field but on the otherhand quite many reported to have found breaking into the data field challenging. 
It was revealed that data scientists earn the highest on average at almost $100,000 per year in comparison to Data Analysts for example, whose earnnings per year are about half of the data scientists'. Also, interesting to find was, the popularity of the Python programming language among the Data Analysts with Java and Java Script being the least liked. 
Lastly, the survey showed that data professionals generally enjoy a work life balance but are not quite satisfied with the salary.
